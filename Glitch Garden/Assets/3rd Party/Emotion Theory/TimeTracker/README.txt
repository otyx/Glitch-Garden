EMOTION THEORY'S TIME TRACKER

This is an invaluable, non-intrusive tool made for automatically keeping track of your game development time in Unity. 

HOW TO USE

You can find your time tracking information displayed automatically in the bottom left corner of the scene view. Once you purchase and import the asset, you do not need to do anything.

FEATURES

* Full Source Code.

* Completely automatic and non-intrusive. You don't need any clunky docked windows that take up your screen space. It begins to work the second you import the package into your project.

* Detailed time tracking graphs statistics. View detailed analytics on your past dev time data by day, week, month, year, or all-time - but only when you want to.

* Project cost calculator. Optionally set a salary per hour which in turn will show you how your time correlates to cost. Handy for gauging roughly how much your project costs in man-hours.

* Export time data to CSV. Create weekly / monthly / annual time / pay sheets.

* Timer runs only when you're working. When the user is idle or away from the computer, time does not count. This makes the timer run accurately and automatically.
